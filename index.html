            This class was a semester long class that you can take for a science credit.</a>
            At first, I did not want to take this class because web design was not something I thought I would enjoy. That quickly changed!
          </p>
          <p>But, once I started getting into the projects and gettinvg the hang of things, it started to become pretty fun. I enjoy being creative and making art and things of that nature. So, naturally as I started to learn and get better at web design, I was able to put those elements into it.</p>

            <h3>Business Card</h3>
            <p> This was the first project we completed. We were required to create a hypothetical business card for a brand that we create. We were only able to use HTML elements. I did not do amazing on this project, but that is okay because it is the first time using a platform like this.</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Choose Your Own Adventure</h3>
          <p>Our second project we got to complete was a choose your own adventure. We could make it about anything that we wanted but it needed to have a plotline and various different ending. I chose to go with the horror route. I was able to add music into the entire story, even though this was not a requirement or something we had learned yet.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>CSS Zen Garden</h3>
          <p>This was my favorite project we did this semester. We had to create a CSS stylesheet without editing any HTML. We needed to create a stylesheet with a very specific theme. I wanted to do an 80s theme because I really enjoy that stereotypical bright retro look.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
          <h3>Imitation</h3>
          <p>The next project was the Imitation Project. We needed to imitate a graphic designers design exactly using everything we have learned so far. I made a Cheezit box. Well, I actually struggled with this. I struggled only because I was not able to do many creative elements. That is why other projects where it was all creative design, I thrived.</p>
          

          
          <h3>JS Problem Set</h3>
          <p>This one wasn't really a project but it was a way to introduce us to JavaScript.</p>
          <h3>Portfolio Project</h3>
          <p>This is actually the project you are currently lookign at! In this one we had to use, HTML, Javascript, and CSS in order to design a portfolio of out projects. This had to have a unique design and flow smoothly! I liked this again, because it was creative and I had a ton of creative freedom in my choices.</p>
          <h1 style="-webkit-text-stroke: #3B3E02 0.1px"> Conclusion</h1>
          <p> Overall, I enjoyed this class. There are a few things I would do differently if I could take it again. I woul like to really try to finish the imitation project as that might be really rewarding if I did it successfully! I hope you enjoyed reading and seeing my work!</p>
